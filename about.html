      <h1 class="text-center mt-5">Who we are?</h1>
      <h3 class="text-center mt-5">We are mainly concerned with changing the mentality of people towards animals. "Prevention" is the watchword, meaning by prevention through information. "An informed man is about 10," says an old proverb. Informed, we will be stronger and the number of cruelties will be lower. Our priority is to change our mentality, of all, regarding animals. At this time we hear on TV just that, "the dog bites, the dog kills." "The dog is the worst enemy." Instead of hearing news like "a dog needs this and that, it eats this, it has to be kept that way, it has to be neutered at age, if not, this, and this" (we pay attention). At this moment, the protection of animals in Romania does not face the large number of cruelties. There are so many animals at a standstill that our range is far exceeded. In our country, but also in all organizations, people call every day who want to take dogs to the shelter, to take them to the vet to be treated for diseases and after accidents, people who want to file complaints for killed animals and for an infinite number of situations.</h3>
